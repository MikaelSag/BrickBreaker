# BrickBreaker

## Description

**Brick Breaker** is a challenging twist on the classic 70s game *Breakout*. Players will progress through 5 increasingly difficult levels, each featuring unique layouts and one special “key brick” that must be hit 3 times to complete the level. Players must complete all 5 levels without running out of lives, which decrease every time the ball goes out of bounds, otherwise, they will have to restart from the first level. The game’s physics and paddle controls are designed to offer precision and satisfaction as players aim to break the key brick and advance to the next level. Featuring progressively harder levels, an engaging puzzle-solving aspect, and immersive visuals and audio, *Brick Breaker* offers an exciting combination of skills and strategy for players.
